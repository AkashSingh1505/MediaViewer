# MediaViewer App

MediaViewer is an Android application that allows users to browse and play video files stored on their device. The app uses Android's `MediaStore` API to fetch videos from external storage and provides a built-in video player with standard media controls.

## Features

- **Browse Local Videos**: List all video files stored on the device using the `MediaStore` API.
- **Video Playback**: Play videos directly within the app with play, pause, and seek controls.
- **Metadata Display**: Display video name and duration in a user-friendly list.
- **Clean Architecture**: Utilizes `ViewModel`, `Repository`, and `Dependency Injection (DI)` patterns to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.
